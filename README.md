## Overview

### The challenge

- Reuse the webapp "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and add the necessary screens to be able to play online with another person. Use this [design](https://www.figma.com/file/eFWnPjb6jXbNQlHFwL1rQI/dwf-m6-desaf%C3%ADo?node-id=0%3A1) as a reference.

- The backend must:
  - Communicate using [restful principles](https://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/2.9/guide/rest_principles/).
  - Allow to create gamerooms.
  - Allow to play (i.e. start and finish games) and keep the room score forever.
  - Have a documented API with Postman and with the link to the documentation in the Readme.md. [API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17951846/UVXbseNH).
